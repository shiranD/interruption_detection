# interruption_detection
This repo detects speech interruption in the strict sense of timing based on speech alone. Therefore, interruption is measured objectively, rather than subjectively through human subjects. Our followup orject is to detect the interruption type (incidating social hierarchy (-), rapport (+), or speech repair (0)) through incorporating textual analysis.
